# HomeSeekers



## About
Welcome to our web application, "Home seekers!" Our mission is to connect loving families with their perfect furry companion. Our main page offers the user the ability to search for pets using their zip code. Our page is then populated with the pets most recently added to shelters in the area. When you click on a pet's content square you are then brought to an info page with details on that specific pet, and provided with a youtube video on how to care for that specific breed. 

ok now lets click on one of those furry friends and head into there page.

Now on top of the name, species,breed, gender, age, and size that are included with this cute little adoptable friends page.
One unique feature of our application is the inclusion of a YouTube video for each dog. These videos provide a more in-depth look at the personality and characteristics of the pet, allowing potential adopters to get a better sense of whether they would be a good match.

i'm thinking this pet could be for me but i wanna keep looking and not lose 
his page, 
well Users can also save their favorite dogs and have it appear on the front of the page, making it easy to keep track of which dogs they are interested in.

We understand that finding the right pet can be a daunting task, but with Home seekers, we hope to make the process as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Thank you for considering adoption and for using our application.
